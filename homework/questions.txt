     git commint -m "message"

    - from working directory to the staging area
    git add "file name"

     This can be done either on Github or in the command line using "gh repo create" command.
     To connect your local repository to the remote one (if you were to create it on github)
     you need to add remote to it. Briefly describe, what would be the commands to do this ?

    - How do you check whether you already have some github/remote repository connected to your local one?
    git remote -v
    - What command do you use to add the remote
    git add remote
  h, When local and remote repository are connected, one can push the changes/files so they are visible
     on github. What would be the structrure of the command ? Do you need to create a pull request?
   git push origin "branch name"
   If I want to merge my changes to the main branch then i will need to create a pull request.

   git clone "repository SSH link"
  b, Do you need to initiate a git repository after cloning a project?
  No because i am cloning this project on Github. It's already a git project.

  c, What is the difference between forking and cloning?
 Forking means copy of a repository and cloning means download a repository in your local machine.
  d, Can you just push your changes to repository that you don't "own" on github?
