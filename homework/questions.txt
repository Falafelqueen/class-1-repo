  absoulte path is the path that starts from the  root directory. starts with /user/username/name_of_directory
   Relative path is the path to the users current location.

  d, What command do you use to see what directory are you currently in?
  pwd

  e, How would you see the files and folders in a directory?
  ls
  cat
  less

  f, How do you go back to your home directory?
  cd ~

  g, How do you create a new folder, can you also specify in the command where you want to save it ?
  mkdir > folder name 

  h, How do you remove a folder/directory, is it the same as removing a file? no its different commands.
  rmdir folder_name to remove a folder. 
  rm file_name to remove a file

  i, What is a file or folder is not empty ? What flag would you use to remove it anyway?
  rm -rf

  j, How do you move a folder/file ? What arguments does the command take?
  mv folder_name 
  -rf

  k, How can you find out more about a command and see the available options, syntax etc.
    (How/Where do you see the manual/help for a command)
    command_name --help

  l, With what command do you rename a folder/file in the command line?
  mv folder_name new_folder_name

  m, How do you copy a folder ?
  cp folder_name Copy_folder_name

  n, What command do you use to open a folder/file ?

  cat

2. Creating a new project
  a, How do you create a new folder (what command) ?
  mkdir folder_name

  b, What command do you use to create/initiate a local repository (from the command line)?
  git init 
     /One can also create a new repository on Github and then just clone it to their machine./

  c, What command do you use to create a new file ?
touch filename

  d, If you create a file and and add text to it, these changes are now on your working directory.
     How would you save these to the local repository (describe the steps with commands)
     1. fork
     2. git clone 
     3. git add file name 
     4. git status to check 
     5. open file from visual code and edit and add text from there. save changes made
     6. git commit -m
     7. git push origin master


    - from working directory to the staging area
    git add folder or file name 

    - from the staging area to local repository
    git push -u origin branch_name

  e, What does git status do ?
  shows state of working directory and the staging area

  f, How would you check your commit history?
  git log

  g, To share your project(folder), you will need to create a remote repository.
     This can be done either on Github or in the command line using "gh repo create" command.
     To connect your local repository to the remote one (if you were to create it on github)
     you need to add remote to it. Briefly describe, what would be the commands to do this ?

     1. create new repository on right side cilck + New repository.
     2. type a name for your repo.
     3. type a short description of you repo.
     4. choose type of visibility wether public, private or internal.
     5. tick initialize repository with readme.
     6. create repository.

    - How do you check whether you already have some github/remote repository connected to your local one?
    git remote -v
    - What command do you use to add the remote
    -git add origin

  h, When local and remote repository are connected, one can push the changes/files so they are visible
     on github. What would be the structrure of the command ? Do you need to create a pull request?
     
     1. git push origin main  .
     2. then pull request from Github.


3. Working on an existing project
  a, To get this homework to your computer you needed to copy a remote repository into your machine.
    What were the commands you needed to use?
    1. git clone "repo"

  b, Do you need to initiate a git repository after cloning a project?


  c, What is the difference between forking and cloning?

  Forking is creating a copy in github. you need to create a pull request before changes can be merged.
  While cloning is creating a copy on your local machine. you need to push back the changes to the repo.

  d, Can you just push your changes to repository that you don't "own" on github?
No you cant.
