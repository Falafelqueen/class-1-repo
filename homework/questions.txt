Here are homework questions for you to recap the concepts
we went through in class.

1. Navigating the terminal
  a, What is a root directory?
	The home directory is a subdirectory of the root directory, while the root directory is the topmost level of the system drive.

  b, What is the difference between root and home directory?
	Home directory is denoted by '~' and has path "/users/username", while root directory is denoted by a slash '/'.	


  c, What is the difference between absolute and relative path?
  An absolute path is defined as specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/). In other words,we can say that an absolute path is a complete path from start of actual file system from / directory. Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd).
	
  d, What command do you use to see what directory are you currently in?
  pwd

  e, How would you see the files and folders in a directory?
  ls

  f, How do you go back to your home directory?
  "cd ~", or "cd"

  g, How do you create a new folder, can you also specify in the command where you want to save it ?
  mkdir Folder_name
  Yes you can specify the path by typing it before the folder name.

  h, How do you remove a folder/directory, is it the same as removing a file?
  rmdir Folder_name
  Yes it is the same. For files "rm file_name" and for folders is "rm -df folder_name" or "rm -rf folder_name" if folder is not empty.

  i, What is a file or folder is not empty ? What flag would you use to remove it anyway?
  rm -rf name_folder

  j, How do you move a folder/file ? What arguments does the command take?
  mv file_or_folder_name path_where_to_move

  k, How can you find out more about a command and see the available options, syntax etc.
    (How/Where do you see the manual/help for a command)
    "command --help", or "man command"

  l, With what command do you rename a folder/file in the command line?
  mv

  m, How do you copy a folder ?
  cp folder_name path_to_copy
  If not empty we use the flag "-r"

  n, What command do you use to open a folder/file ?
  open folder_or_file_name

2. Creating a new project
  a, How do you create a new folder (what command) ?
  mkdir folder_name

  b, What command do you use to create/initiate a local repository (from the command line)?
     /One can also create a new repository on Github and then just clone it to their machine./
     git init -b master
     git clone repo_link

  c, What command do you use to create a new file ?
  touch file_name

  d, If you create a file and and add text to it, these changes are now on your working directory.
     How would you save these to the local repository (describe the steps with commands)

    - from working directory to the staging area
    git add file_name

    - from the staging area to local repository
    git commit -m "message"

  e, What does git status do ?
  Show the status of the staging area.

  f, How would you check your commit history?
  git log

  g, To share your project(folder), you will need to create a remote repository.
     This can be done either on Github or in the command line using "gh repo create" command.
     To connect your local repository to the remote one (if you were to create it on github)
     you need to add remote to it. Briefly describe, what would be the commands to do this ?

    - How do you check whether you already have some github/remote repository connected to your local one?
    git remote -v

    - What command do you use to add the remote
    git remote add origin repo_link


  h, When local and remote repository are connected, one can push the changes/files so they are visible
     on github. What would be the structrure of the command ? Do you need to create a pull request?
  First we have to do pull request to synchronize the local repo with the remote one, "git pull". Then we do the push by typing "git push origin master"

3. Working on an existing project
  a, To get this homework to your computer you needed to copy a remote repository into your machine.
    What were the commands you needed to use?
    git clone the_repo_link

  b, Do you need to initiate a git repository after cloning a project?
  No

  c, What is the difference between forking and cloning?
  Cloning is working directly on the original repo, while forking is creating your repo using the original repo.

  d, Can you just push your changes to repository that you don't "own" on github?
  No, except you have the permission.
