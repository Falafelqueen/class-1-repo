Here are homework questions for you to recap the concepts
we went through in class.

1. Navigating the terminal
  a, What is a root directory?
  - A root directory is a main directory that a computer has. 
  It contains all the essential files and folders that the computer needs
  and it is noted by a "/".

  b, What is the difference between root and home directory?
  - Root directory a directory where all important files and folders that a machine needs are located.
   It is denoted by / and home directory is one of the sub-directory of 
   the root directory and it is denoted with "~".

  c, What is the difference between absolute and relative path?
  = An absolute path is a path starting from the root directory. For example: cd /Users/rishgrg/Desktop is 
  an absolute path where as, a relative path is a current directory that I'm working on, for ex: cd Desktop

  d, What command do you use to see what directory are you currently in?
  - "pwd" command 

  e, How would you see the files and folders in a directory?
  - "ls" 

  f, How do you go back to your home directory?
  - "cd" or cd ~

  g, How do you create a new folder, can you also specify in the command where you want to save it ?
  = mkdir name-of-a-new-folder

  h, How do you remove a folder/directory, is it the same as removing a file?
  = rm -r name-of-the-direcotry/folder OR rmdir name-of-the-folder

  i, What is a file or folder is not empty ? What flag would you use to remove it anyway?
  = It means that the file/folder contains come contents which cannot be removed, and for this we need to 
  use flag -r so that we can remove it anyway.

  j, How do you move a folder/file ? What arguments does the command take?
 = to move files and folders we need to use the command "mv". The arguments it takes are 
 the file we want to move and the directory we want to move the file into.

  k, How can you find out more about a command and see the available options, syntax etc.
    (How/Where do you see the manual/help for a command)
    = with the command "man".

  l, With what command do you rename a folder/file in the command line?
  = mv old_folder_name_ new_folder_name

  m, How do you copy a folder ?
  = cp -r name-of-the-folder name-of-the-copy-folder

  n, What command do you use to open a folder/file ?
  = by using the command "cat" or "less" 

2. Creating a new project
  a, How do you create a new folder (what command) ?
  = mkdir "folder's name"

  b, What command do you use to create/initiate a local repository (from the command line)?
     /One can also create a new repository on Github and then just clone it to their machine./
 = by using the command "git init"

  c, What command do you use to create a new file ?
  = touch "name-of-the-file"

  d, If you create a file and and add text to it, these changes are now on your working directory.
     How would you save these to the local repository (describe the steps with commands)
  = we need to start with "git init" then with "git status" we check the changes,
  and with git add "." (if we want to include all files) or the "name-of-the-file" if only seleted file.
   then, git commit -m "comment" and git push origin master. 

    - from working directory to the staging area
    = git add 

    - from the staging area to local repository
    = git commit -m 

  e, What does git status do ?
  = "git status" provides us info on the changes we have made on our repo.

  f, How would you check your commit history?
  - git log

  g, To share your project(folder), you will need to create a remote repository.
     This can be done either on Github or in the command line using "gh repo create" command.
     To connect your local repository to the remote one (if you were to create it on github)
     you need to add remote to it. Briefly describe, what would be the commands to do this ?

    - How do you check whether you already have some github/remote repository connected to your local one?
  = git remote -v (it verifies that the remote URL is set correctly)

    - What command do you use to add the remote
  = origin to add changes on the fork file/repo and upstream to the parent repo

  h, When local and remote repository are connected, one can push the changes/files so they are visible
     on github. What would be the structrure of the command ? Do you need to create a pull request?
  = git push origin master 

3. Working on an existing project
  a, To get this homework to your computer you needed to copy a remote repository into your machine.
    What were the commands you needed to use?
= git clone "URL"
  b, Do you need to initiate a git repository after cloning a project?
  - No

  c, What is the difference between forking and cloning?
  - Forking is when we can to make a copy of a repository that we would like to work on as we can get in on our name on GitHub
  so that we can work and make changes on it. Whereas, while cloning a project we cannot make changes to it unless we have 
  a permission or someone has invited to collaborate on it.

  d, Can you just push your changes to repository that you don't "own" on github?
  - No, we first need to fork the repo that we would like to work on and then clone it so that we can do some changes to it.
