Here are homework questions for you to recap the concepts
we went through in class.

1. Navigating the terminal
  a, What is a root directory?
The home directory is a subdirectory of the root directory, while the root directory is the topmost level of the system drive.
  b, What is the difference between root and home directory?
Root directory contains all other directories and files on the system while home directory (which is also included in root directory) only contains certain user's directories and files.
  c, What is the difference between absolute and relative path?
A relative path describes the location of a file relative to the current directory while the absolute path describes the location from the root directory.
  d, What command do you use to see what directory are you currently in?
By using pwd command
  e, How would you see the files and folders in a directory?
By using ls command
  f, How do you go back to your home directory?
By using cd ~ command
  g, How do you create a new folder, can you also specify in the command where you want to save it ?
By using mkdir command we can create a new file. Yes we can specify.
  h, How do you remove a folder/directory, is it the same as removing a file?
To remove a folder we rm -rf folder name. And for removing a file we don't need to use a flag (-rf).
  i, What is a file or folder is not empty ? What flag would you use to remove it anyway?
We will use -rf flag (rm -rf folder-name)
  j, How do you move a folder/file ? What arguments does the command take?
By using mv folder/file new-location. Existing file name and new location. 
  k, How can you find out more about a command and see the available options, syntax etc.
    (How/Where do you see the manual/help for a command)
By typing man command. We can see options available for that specific command.
  l, With what command do you rename a folder/file in the command line?
By using mv folder-name new-name 
  m, How do you copy a folder ?
by using a cp folder-name loaction command. And if it is not a empty folder we will use a flag -r. 
  n, What command do you use to open a folder/file ?
By using open folder/file-name command
2. Creating a new project
  a, How do you create a new folder (what command) ?
By the command mkdir. 
  b, What command do you use to create/initiate a local repository (from the command line)?
     /One can also create a new repository on Github and then just clone it to their machine./
By the command git init.
  c, What command do you use to create a new file ?
By using touch command.
  d, If you create a file and and add text to it, these changes are now on your working directory.
     How would you save these to the local repository (describe the steps with commands)

    - from working directory to the staging area
By using git add file-name or git add .
    - from the staging area to local repository
By the command git commit file-name
  e, What does git status do ?
Tells the status of the file.
  f, How would you check your commit history?
By the command git log
  g, To share your project(folder), you will need to create a remote repository.
     This can be done either on Github or in the command line using "gh repo create" command.
     To connect your local repository to the remote one (if you were to create it on github)
     you need to add remote to it. Briefly describe, what would be the commands to do this ?

    - How do you check whether you already have some github/remote repository connected to your local one?
By using the command git remote -v
    - What command do you use to add the remote
We will use the command git remote add origin url
  h, When local and remote repository are connected, one can push the changes/files so they are visible
     on github. What would be the structrure of the command ? Do you need to create a pull request?
Yes we have to make a pull request. 

3. Working on an existing project
  a, To get this homework to your computer you needed to copy a remote repository into your machine.
    What were the commands you needed to use?
git clone
  b, Do you need to initiate a git repository after cloning a project?
No
  c, What is the difference between forking and cloning?
Cloning is working directly on the original repo, while forking is creating your repo using the original repo. 
  d, Can you just push your changes to repository that you don't "own" on github?
No,except you have the permission.
