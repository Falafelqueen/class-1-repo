Here are homework questions for you to recap the concepts
we went through in class.

1. Navigating the terminal
  a, What is a root directory?
    the first directory.
  b, What is the difference between root and home directory?
    home directory is a subdirectory of the root directory.
  c, What is the difference between absolute and relative path?
    absolute path is the path from root directory. And relative path is a path from the same directory. 
  d, What command do you use to see what directory are you currently in?
    pwd.
  e, How would you see the files and folders in a directory?
    with the "ls" command.
  f, How do you go back to your home directory?
    with "cd"
  g, How do you create a new folder, can you also specify in the command where you want to save it ?
    "mkdir newfolder". Add the path. 
  h, How do you remove a folder/directory, is it the same as removing a file?
    - to remove a file, you can use "rm newfile". 
    - to remove a folder or directory you can use "rmdir"
  i, What is a file or folder is not empty ? What flag would you use to remove it anyway?
     rm -r newdirectory
  j, How do you move a folder/file ? What arguments does the command take?
    mv arg1 arg2, where arg1(argument) is the original name and arg2(argument) is new position and, if required, new name  
  k, How can you find out more about a command and see the available options, syntax etc.
    (How/Where do you see the manual/help for a command)
    with the command "man something"
  l, With what command do you rename a folder/file in the command line?
    "mv oldname newname"
  m, How do you copy a folder ?
    "cp oldlocation new location"
  n, What command do you use to open a folder/file ?
    cd folder/file
2. Creating a new project
  a, How do you create a new folder (what command) ?
    mkdir newfolder
  b, What command do you use to create/initiate a local repository (from the command line)?
     /One can also create a new repository on Github and then just clone it to their machine./
    git init name
  c, What command do you use to create a new file ?
    touch newfile
  d, If you create a file and and add text to it, these changes are now on your working directory.
     How would you save these to the local repository (describe the steps with commands)
    first, git status to see the status of this changes. 
    - from working directory to the staging area
    git add .
    - from the staging area to local repository
    git commit -m "description of changes"
  e, What does git status do ?
    see the changes status on file
  f, How would you check your commit history?
    git log
  g, To share your project(folder), you will need to create a remote repository.
     This can be done either on Github or in the command line using "gh repo create" command.
     To connect your local repository to the remote one (if you were to create it on github)
     you need to add remote to it. Briefly describe, what would be the commands to do this ?
    with "git remote add origin linkgithubofremoterepo"
    - How do you check whether you already have some github/remote repository connected to your local one?
      git remote
    - What command do you use to add the remote
      "git remote add origin linkgithubofremoterepo"
  h, When local and remote repository are connected, one can push the changes/files so they are visible
     on github. What would be the structrure of the command ? Do you need to create a pull request?
    the command is "git push remoterepo localrepo". I cand do the push without pull request. 

3. Working on an existing project
  a, To get this homework to your computer you needed to copy a remote repository into your machine.
    What were the commands you needed to use?
    on my machine, I created a new folder and did git clone inside it with the link from github. 
  b, Do you need to initiate a git repository after cloning a project?
    no
  c, What is the difference between forking and cloning?
    Fork is just a copy of the repository who receives the changes. And with clone is possible send the changes for original repository
  d, Can you just push your changes to repository that you don't "own" on github?
    Yes, but I have to do PR and it has to be aproved.
