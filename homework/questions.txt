  Ans: To create/initiate local repository we use "git init -b master/main" command.
  c, What command do you use to create a new file ?
  Ans: We use "touch file-name.txt" to create a new file.
  d, If you create a file and and add text to it, these changes are now on your working directory.
     How would you save these to the local repository (describe the steps with commands)
    Ans:
    1-We will use command "touch file_name" to create new file. 
    2- Then to add text in file we use "echo "text line" > file-name.txt" command.
    - from working directory to the staging area
    To move from working directory to staging directory we use "git add file-name.txt" command.
    - from the staging area to local repository
    For stagging area to local repository we use (git commit -m "our message").
  
  e, What does git status do ?
  Ans: Git status commadn show the current status of the working directory and the staging area. And also tells us which chnages are done and which are not.

  g, To share your project(folder), you will need to create a remote repository.
     This can be done either on Github or in the command line using "gh repo create" command.
     To connect your local repository to the remote one (if you were to create it on github)
     you need to add remote to it. Briefly describe, what would be the commands to do this ?
  Ans: To add remote repository to local repository we need to be in that directory, then we use [git remote add origin "SSH/HTML link of remote repository"] command.
    
    - How do you check whether you already have some github/remote repository connected to your local one?
  Ans: To check if there is any remote repository that is connected to local repository or not, we use (git remote -v) command.

    - What command do you use to add the remote
  Ans: To add remote we use [git remote add origin "SSH/HTML link of remote repository"] command.

  h, When local and remote repository are connected, one can push the changes/files so they are visible
     on github. What would be the structrure of the command ? Do you need to create a pull request?
     Ans: When local repository and remote repository are connected then just for pushing changes/files we use (git commit -m "message") command 
     to commit files/changes and then we use (git push -u origin master) command to push the files/changes to remote repository, and if you are not the owner of files and
     doing changing in fork then after doing changing in file you can pull request to file owner for merging these changing to original file.

3. Working on an existing project
  a, To get this homework to your computer you needed to copy a remote repository into your machine.
    What were the commands you needed to use?
  Ans:To get that files to my local repository i request fork to that remote repository and then use [git clone "ssh/html link"] to get that files in my local repository.
  
  b, Do you need to initiate a git repository after cloning a project?
  Ans: No after that i just commit changes and push back to remote repository. 

  c, What is the difference between forking and cloning?
  Ans: Forking is to create a copy of repository on remote location (github). 
  Cloning is when you move repository from your remote directory to local pc.Cloning make a local copy of repository not your own.
